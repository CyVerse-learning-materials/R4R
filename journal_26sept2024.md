**Rose:**
The highlight was learning the Command Line Interface (CLI) for the first time. It gave me control over file management and automation through shell scripts, which could be very useful for my LCA and techno-economic analysis work.

**Bud:**
I am excited to apply shell scripting and CLI to automate data tasks in my LCA and GIS projects as I become more familiar with it. These skills will help me manage large datasets for my research on waste conversion and lithium-ion battery recycling.

**Thorn:**
As I was completely new to CLI, I found it challenging to keep up with the commands during the class.
