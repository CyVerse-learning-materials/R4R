ROSE: I'm very enthusiastic about scientific communication. Thus far, this has been the session I have enjoyed the most. I'd encourage everyone to utilize Quarto, as it makes combining plain text, code chunks, LaTeX, and even Zotero easier. I'm actually using Quarto to write my dissertation.

BUD: GitHub Wiki is new to me. I will explore it more soon, especially when I have to organize class materials. 

THORN: Website development is tricky. I appreciate the knowledgeable explanation of the structure of a website's main repository.
