### Rose:
How you might use version control specifically in your projects. Are you currently doing any coding or web development? Are you collaborating with anyone on analysis?

I am currently studying how different climate variables impact health. In my research, I do extensive data analysis. I can use version control to share the code with another researcher as reproducible research. 
Currently, I am working on developing my own GitHub website. Yes, I collaborate with researchers from other partner institutes of our project.

### Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

This is the first time I learned about version control. I found it to be an exciting and handy tool. 
I want to use it to manage my research data file, perform reproducible coding, collaborate with other team members, and integrate my research with my website.

### Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

I want to know more about managing large data sets with the version control system.
