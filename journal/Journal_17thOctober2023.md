Following the Rose/Bud/Thorn model:

# **Rose**
In general, architecture (and design) professions save data in the form of graphical presentation. But coming into research, text data and it's version control have gained vital importance. GIT and GIThub knowledge was essential for me. I have been using Github to preserve my progress as an R4R fellow and trying to maintain a progress journal for my research as well. As I often work parallel on multiple papers branching from the same core idea, this progress tracking is already helping me to keep track of my work. Also, preservation of codes and it's version control became easier. My thesis research started from the idea of "Architectural Design process Automation". But now the research is delving more into 3D GAN based systems where automated systems will learn to think like an architect. But this transition needed proper data management and version control which this knowledge of Git and Github can help with.

# **Bud**
My recent work in 3D GAN is a combination of traditional graphical data and programming data (text based data). Some of my work contains Geospatial data which also both vector and text data. Interestingly, as R4R fellows we are granted access to cyverse's portal which would be a great resource for storing and managing these data. I tend to make my research open source. So having access to such platform would certainly be a great help. Also, the platform having unix environment would help with the code based data as well.

# **Thorn**
Some of the graphic based data (e.g: Image, visual data, 3D models) need version control as well. Platforms like Box, Google drive offers that window now. But it requires files to have the same name and are not always designed for such data management. I am interested to know how we can manage other forms of data in this regard. Also, the MK docs website feature- I could not follow the step by step tutorial on that for not having access to my cyverse account. Hopefully this week I would be able to catch up to that.
