### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
It was so interesting to learn about the role that containers play in reproducible science. I am not sure how I could implement the use of containers directly within my research but I see how it could be useful in communities with limited resources.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.
I am looking forward to learning how to use containers to develop an App that could potentially be used to track eligibility and enrollment in Medicaid for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States. Some states have a Medicaid app but Arizona does not.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?
I am still trying to wrap my head around how containers can be used for big data and analytics. Are there any hands-on tutorials on how to run a container for this purpose?
