### Rose:  
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

The last FOSS session was very resourceful, and I learned something new. I previously used Command Line Interface (CLI) for different purposes but did not know much about it. 
With this session, I learned about it. I think this will help me explore CLI more. Another important topic discussed in the session was LLM Chatbots for Open Science. 
I learned a bit about using Chatbot, which is also helpful. I am still deciding about implementing something. However, I want to explore CLI more and use the LLM Chatbots. 

### Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I want to dig deeper into CLI. How I can use it in my research or other work is still confusing. However, learning more about it will help me overcome this confusion.
In addition, the multidimensional usage of chatbots is one of the essential skills I can use in my current and future research. 

### Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

I am still confused about the creation of the shell script. Though I got the main idea, some codes did not work. Furthermore, chatbot prompts could be discussed more as they are a trending topic nowadays.
