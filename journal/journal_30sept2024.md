# Learner Log Entry #2

## Prompts

### Rose:
This lesson was a good into tutorial for begginers with the command line.

### Bud: 
There were some good tips on ways to apply LLM tools in workflows (although I still have a healthy amount of skepticism about the hype around them).

### Thorn: 
I have been using the command line for years, so there wasn't a lot new for me this week, but I'm sure it was useful for others.
