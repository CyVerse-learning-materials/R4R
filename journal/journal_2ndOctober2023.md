  **Learner Log Entry #4**

Prompts
Following the Rose/Bud/Thorn model:

### **Rose:**
The importance of project management sometimes start with simple file management. There is a section in the lesson that talks about the best practices of project management. I feel this is something that is right infront of us as common sense, but having it structued makes me realize how having an organized system is an universal asset for both academia and industry projects. For example, having a "READ ME" file for everything sounds like a basic thing to do. But the idea of reusability and replicability of data can start from this very basic step. Its most importantly having that mindset. In my research (and profession) I will start doing this deliberately and will try to organize data to make it transfarable and making work process replicable integral part of my management system.

### **Bud:**
For this lesson, I feel like having a lot of quantitive resource opens a number of doors for me. For example. there are updated resources on RStudio with detailed instructions for R Packages. Also there are resources regarding productivity software and project management systems. Although I have used a handful of these before, I feel I could explore all the options and find my best fit. Having access to these resources (at one place) is something I feel I could be benifited from going forward with my research. I am using Atlassian's Jira for last week. I work alone for my research efforts, but it has been evident that this will help a lot if there are more people doing multiple layers of work if they work through this system.

### **Thorn:**
We talked a bit about PMP in the session. I had some prior ideas about the certification and here having the discussion made me interested. It would be great if we could get a seperate overview session from a PMP expert on that. I found some documents and resources on this but I feel lost among different points of views on this aspect. Also, some technical sessions showing how to use project management platforms (especially in research environment) would be very helpful.

### **Additional thought:**
I feel many of the things we are learning covers really large topics within the designated time. While this is good for us as starters, some of us would definitely stick to at least one of the core teachings of the cohort. For example, I personally feel data and project management would be with my journey all around. I would like to know how we can sharpen our skills regarding these topics beyond the fellowship and is there anyway any of the involved bodies with this cohort can help us out?
