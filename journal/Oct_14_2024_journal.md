### Partner discussions:
Last week I chatted with Edwin and we primarily talked about our research. Edwin is a PhD candidate in Government anf Public Policy. He applies data sciences skills in studying the governance of invasive species. In addition to discussing about our individual research, we also chatted about the policy, regulation and misinformation around Genetic Modified foods (GM-foods).
