Rose:
I found the concept of containers for reproducible science particularly useful. By packaging code and its dependencies in a container, I can ensure that my research, which includes technoeconomic analysis and life cycle assessments (LCA) of rare earth elements recovery, is easily reproducible by colleagues without compatibility issues.

Bud:
I look forward to exploring how containers can be applied to my own research, particularly in optimizing the sustainability of rare earth metal recovery. I plan to look into various online resources where this has been utilized as I currently use a software for my LCA and not packages and codes.

Thorn:
While the concept is promising, the technical learning curve is something I need to work on to effectively implement this in my research.
