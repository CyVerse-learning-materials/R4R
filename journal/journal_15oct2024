## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

In the sixth week of FOSS we learned about the reproducibility using Conda. We used codespaces to learn the importance of environment. It was interesting to learn about saving the environment for future run so the work can be
reproduce.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I am not sure how I can implement this in my research for noe. My work is using comerical FE software, most of the time, the latest version can run the old versions. One thing is the old elements/components/functions
might not be available in the latest version. I see the importance of mentioning the vesion of the sotware, this is a common practice in research paper writing.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

Nothing in particular at this point.

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
