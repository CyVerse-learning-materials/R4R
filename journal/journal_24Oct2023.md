## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I've always been interested in getting better at using conda and being able to do more things with the command line other than "git commit" and "git push". I work in the conda command line terminal because it comes with Anaconda so this is a good way to clarify what it's doing and how I can do more with it.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

This seems like it can be really useful for my own work and I'd love to start trying to use it more often as I'm currently working on a library computer. I'm also interested in using this for when I get into the analysis stage of my work that deals with applying network science and neural networks to multi-modal data. This seems very useful.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

This was an interesting topic, but I'm not sure how the process we went through means it makes something repeatable. Is it just the fact that it's stored in the cloud? Similarly, it might not be too helpful for those who don't have access to cloud technologies ... or did I miss something?


## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

I'm sorry if I missed this, but how much space is available to students on cyverse?
