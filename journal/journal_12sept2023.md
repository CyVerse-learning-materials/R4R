## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The introduction of Linux into windows platform was interesting. This does help me understand the prospect of a different type of computing that I am used to.
The use of GPT 4.00 was very intreaguing. This opens newer dimensions to analytical research.

### Bud: 
The GPT 4.0 Quantitigve data analysis and data visualization would be very helpful to my research. I am willing to learn more about it.
I am more interested now to learn linux based operating system and this new infrastructure for computing. I do want to know the reasons of it being so dear to the programming community.

### Thorn: 
I suffered immensely installing the linux windows system into the windows platform. There were multiple error. I had to access multiple machines to finally use it.
The process of editing files or accessing them is clear. However the process of saving it and how the interaction buttons work is not clear.

## Additional thought
I could not save the edited file from my machine.
Navigating through files needs some more context from my end.
