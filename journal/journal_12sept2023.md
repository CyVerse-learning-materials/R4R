# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

For the session on Thursday (9/7/2023) I was really excited to know that we'd be working with version control systems including GitHub. I'm also very appreciative of the resources that are being provided particularly the HackMD, the foss.cyverse tutorial materials and other materials being provided.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

I'm also happy to know that we'll be encouraged to work from the command line and hope to beef up my shell skills to better navigate and talk to the machine! Particularly I'm excited to learn about or dig deeper into [The Unix Shell, Git, Github and LLMs]{https://foss.cyverse.org/00_basics/#prompt-writing}.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

I've been through this type of unix shell, git tutorial a couple of times before, but I still seem to learn one or two new things. I will say becasue I have been through similar workshops I found myself losing focus at times. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

I will ask this later, but I'm wondering how long and/or descriptive these blogs have to be. I feel like later in the semester I'll have more thoughts for this but the first one is a tester on.
