### Rose:
The introduction of Linux into windows platform was intereting. This does help me understand the prospect of a different type of computing that I am used to.
The use of GPT 4.0 was very intreaguing. This opens newere dimensions to analytical research.

### Bud: 
The GPT 4.0 quantitive data analysis and data visualization would be very helpful to my research. I am willing to learn more about that and it's extent of capacity especially in 3D visualization of Data.
I am more interested now to learn Linux based computation and infrastructure of computing. I want to figure out it's implication in my research.

### Thorn: 
I suffered immensely installing the Linux system into the windows platform. There were multiple error and I had to have access of multiple machines to finally use it.
The process of editing files is clear. However, the process of saving it or how the instruction button works are not clear.

## Additional thought
I could not save the edited file so had to fork the changes from github online. Which was not idea. I want to get clear idea on that.
I want to know about saving files and directory management for manual override of codes.
