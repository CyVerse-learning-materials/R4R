Rose: I was first reminded of the captone project (3 to 7 minutes presentation) coming up on the 21st of November, 2024. During the FOSS session one key takeaway was that it is possible for others to use our research work and bulding upon it and also take it to the next step. The topic was kind of interesting because scientific computing like codes, analysis and so on can be reproduced.  I am excited to integrate this technique in my research on lifecycle assessments and recycling optimization. 

Bud: I was recently checking github and I bump into some repository on lifecycle assesment and technoeconomic analysis tools. I am looking forward to checking them out and using them when need be.
 
Thorn: As I learnt from the class, reproducing scientific computing might not be that easy. Some scientific computing can be cumbersome and not so easy to follow.
