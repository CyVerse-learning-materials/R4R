ROSE: The review of Docker commands is very handy. I bookmarked the lesson's website as a reference for the future. The analogy between software containers and shipping containers provides conceptual clarity. 

THORN: It was cool to see Michele "rolling with the punches" when Docker continued to run the "helloworld" image. The lesson was dense, though. I will need more time to grasp the difference between virtual machines and containers.

BUD: This is not necessarily about the content of the lesson but about the format itself. First, the font size in the GitHub Codespace is quite small, making it difficult to follow the recording. Second, I have concluded that the R4R schedule should be in-person meetings on Thursdays to do the FOSS lesson and a virtual meeting on Tuesdays to have small talk. That change could improve group engagement.
