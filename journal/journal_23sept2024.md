## Prompts

### Rose:
This lesson was a great set of tools for making and presenting documentation. The hands on construction of a webpage was a particularly useful tutorial.

### Bud: 
I am looking forward to expanding on the lesson to make documentation for my own projects that is a more professional quality. 

### Thorn: 
It might have been good to give some examples of good vs bad documentation to get a clearer idea what we are working towards.
