# Learner Log Entry #7

### Rose:
The FOSS lesson was easy to follow along with, even if much of the content was over my head. I'm glad that I will be able to use this as a resource in the future (right?).

### Bud: 
As I've mentioned before, future research projects for me might involve using EnergyPlus. At that time I will need to look into whether containers or environments are a better fit for project reproducibility.

### Thorn: 
It was a bit frustrating to see how easy it was for experts to get lost or make mistakes while running containers.
