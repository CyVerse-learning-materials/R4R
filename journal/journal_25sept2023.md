## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I really enjoyed learning that there was some type of reason to setting up open science and we're not just throwing things out there for the sake of it. I also appreciated the insight from the visiting speaker as it was great to hear how the process was thought about and why things are set-up the way they are. It was insightful and helpful.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

I'm excited to get started with creating a data management plan, and even more greatful that there is a good skeleten to follow to help me organize my thoughts on my data project in a standard format. I'm also excited that this is reproducible and can use it in my GRA-ship.


### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

I think having examples of good data management plans would be helpful, like how are researchers from different fields going about managing their projects?


## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

I need to begin getting my research ready for the overall project.
