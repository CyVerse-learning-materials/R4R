# Learner Log Entry #2

## Prompts

### Rose:

This lesson was a good overview of the standards, expectations, and benefits of good data management. This gives me a few ideas for how I can improve data management in early stages of a project, long before publication.

### Bud: 

It will be good to tie this more directly to our work, by better understanding our existing data management plans, or creating new or better plans for our own work.

### Thorn: 

I think the lesson would have benefitted from some more concrete examples beyond just presenting a set of principles. The breakout discussions were a good start, but having a couple examples to work through as a group would have been good
