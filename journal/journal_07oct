ROSE: A solid review of Git commands and GitHub never hurts. The emphasis on the README file and the license was in order and made me realize that I have been neglectful of it in the past. 

BUD: I would like to explore some "small things" in project management and organization. 
--How do you keep your repos cleaned and well-organized? 
--Do you have a default way of structuring your working directories? 
--Do you have a predetermined structure of folders and files? 
--What conventions do you follow when naming folders and files? 
--How do you decide when to create a folder or a file? 
--Let's say you have to delete something; do you actually delete it? 
--If you have a workflow of scripts, how do you ensure that other people will follow the hierarchy in which those scripts should be executed? 
--Suppose a stakeholder is not very enthusiastic about GitHub stuff and requires you to submit—say—weekly reports to keep track of progress; how do you manage all those report versions that accumulate over time?

THORN: A tough session to lead. Michele did a great job. I am still curious about how you overcome the large dataset problem.
