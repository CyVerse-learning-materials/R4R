### Rose:
Before last week's session, I already knew about project documentation as it's an important part of my current research. It was a good opportunity to discuss about some of the best practices in documentation and learn about some tools I wasn't aware of.


### Bud:
I'm interested in learning how I can improve on the current basic look of my website to something much cooler.



### Thorn:

### Partner discussions:
My group member and I discussed about our research focusing on the kind of data we generate and how we store them. He is a civil engineering and he does a lot of simulation in his research. Because his research is funded by the National Science Foundation, they are mandated to store all their data on a cloud service provided by NSF.
