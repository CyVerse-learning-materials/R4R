# Learner Log Entry #6

### Rose:
I could make my current pilot study more reproducible by publishing my data and code for statistical analysis on GitHub - once I get to that point in the study.

### Bud: 
I will likely find using conda environments useful in future research projects. My future research will likely involve working with EnergyPlus (https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus), which is a whole building energy simulation program. I typically work with GUI, but EnergyPlus is a console-based program, so setting up a conda environment may be useful for collaboration and eventual publication.

### Thorn: 
In my field of work, many colleagues and audiences are graphically-oriented people. Frankly, if an interface does not look appealing and interaction does not appear intuitive, it will not be used much. This is a limit to reproducibility, as it essential means that a GUI or clear step-by-step tutorial must be added. The former is time-intensive, and the latter leaves open the possibility of user error.

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects.
