# Learner Log Entry #5

### Rose:
I have already added the dependencies for my latest research project to the [Github repository](https://github.com/csoloff/ACTIVATE_CCN_closure) so my results can be easily reproduced.

### Bud:
I look forward to organizing my environments better. There is code that someone else in my research group wrote that my computer has trouble running. But if I just ask him to send me the requirements files I think I'll be able to run his code.

### Thorn:
Because I used multiple methods for installing python on my computer it is complicated to understand what environment I am working in. I also am unsure how to use pip to install a package only to a specific environment, not the default one.
