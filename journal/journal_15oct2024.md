## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:

As someone who has struggled to reproduce another person's work, it was really cool to have an intro into what I can do to avoid causing the same issue for someone else. Using scripted code seems like the most straightforward solution, but I'm no stranger to the fact that it requires much more in-depth coding knowledge. Maybe it is an opportunity to challenge myself and save someone else a headache.  

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I'm hoping that I can make a personal website as my Capstone project! I'm excited to learn more about how I can incorporate different components of a website using markdown and (maybe) some html from chat-gpt :) 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

I'm curious to know what would be the best steps to take when you are trying to reproduce someone else's code and run into issues. Is there any way to "reverse engineer" it? Is there any recommendation about when to try to do that vs. how to know when it isn't worth your time? Last thing on this point, my concern in making sure that someone else can reproduce my work is that, as the author/creator, it is often challenging to go back and make sure that you've explained something in enough detail that someone, without any of my experience, could reproduce my work. Are there any recommendations about what areas to pay specific attention to? Should we have a friend try and follow our directions? I'm just brainstorming here at this point, but my main point is that I'd like to know (if possible) what steps do you take to ensure you're being as thorough as possible without wasting time. 

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
