Rose: I enjoyed learnign about containers using Conda. I would like to buil my own container for a simulation code I and collaborators have developed in my lab. 
This software uses tskit and gsl and is coded in C. It has been difficult to train people to run the software so having a container would be beneficial for future work.

Bud: I would like to deep my knowdelege into building containers and use it on my research.

Thorn: It would be useful if you could add some information about how conda differs from mamba. 
I received an email recently saying that HPC will stop using conda in the future and people should migrate their programs into using mamba.
