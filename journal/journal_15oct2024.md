# Learner Log Entry #2

### Rose:
Overall, I enjoyed the discussion of reproducibility. I never thought too much about it because I usually keep my code very well-organized and nicely commented. However, over the summer I worked on the project that involved translating someone else's code from STATA to R and, suffices to say, their code was somewhat of a disaster making my life harder. Definitely learned the value of reproducibility there and looking forward to expanding on this topic over the next two weeks.

### Bud: 
As touched on above, I am looking forward to diving more into reproducibility. Topics such as containers are things I've heard of in passing, but never learned about so that should be a fun and new topic to discover.

### Thorn: 
One challenging topic from this week's FOSS session was simply using the command line to interact with conda. I know the basics of the command line, but try to avoid it when possible (like using GitHub desktop instead of Git). I just need to start forcing myself to use the command line to get more comfortable with it. I've been getting better just by practicing with the topics we've gone over.
