### Rose:
One of the highlights of this session for me was learning more about the FAIR data principles. A large part of my research involves re-analyzing previous generated data in addition to generating new data. This session got me thinking about things that I can do to ensure that my data/scripts are FAIR.


### Bud:
I got to know about the CARE principle for the first time during this session. I found this interesting and I would like to read up more on it. Although the CARE principle doesn't directly apply to my current research, it is still an important knowledge!



### Thorn:
I would like to learn more on how to integrate the use of data management tool.


### Partner discussions:
It was the second meeting of the semester so the group discussion was basically focused on getting to know each others better and also knowing more about the goals/expectations of the fellowship
