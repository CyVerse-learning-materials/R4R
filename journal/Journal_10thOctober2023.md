Prompts
Following the Rose/Bud/Thorn model:

### **Rose:**
The academic pedagogy of architecture and any kind of design curriculum is mostly project based. These projects often demand collecting and visualizing a large volume of contextual data. (e.g. For any architectural project site context, climatic data, history of the place, populace data and user data etc.). More often than not these data needs to be reused. For example, a site report for an academic project can be used on another academic or even a professional one. However, while presenting the data- we hardly think about this aspects. Even if we do, a proper documentation system has never been part of this currniculum. Interestingly, the tutorial, how to guides, explanation and reference framework is there but the ideas of treating codes (urban and building) as metadata or creating repositories are not well disciplined in this realm. So, getting to know about "Data Lifecycle planning" and getting introduced some document tools can create new ventures for the profession over all.

### **Bud:**
I have a personal website as having a portfolio for everyone to see is very important in my line of work and research. I built my existing website using google sites based on a template. This week, MKDocs based github pages were shown on the Hands-on section. Which I believe is worth exploring more to make my existing website more dynamic. Also, as I am getting more proficient in programming because of my current research, its essential to make some codes part of my portfolio. My current website structure could make it difficult. But this will create possibilities which i can get benefit from.

### **Thorn:**
This week's "dark side of the moon" for me would also revolve around my portfolio as that is the core documentation and communcation media for me both as an architect, researcher and academician. While tools like MKDocs, bookdown jupyterBook are great for text based data documentation, version control and replicability- much of our work is visual sometimes interactive. Thing is often- there is no sourcecode of such illustrations, drawings, maps or data clusters. I would like to get ideas about maintaining such elements as part of documentation. 

### **Additional thought:**
For my presentation to the department- I feel this week's presentation combined with three previous one's makes a good case. As I wrote on the Rose part of today's journal- our educational pedagogy is project based and all of the degrees are treated as "liscence granting professional degrees"- research is often integrated within project work. Architects traditionally tend to keep good visual documentation of their visual work (e.g: project drawings, diagrams, presentation sheets etc.). However, I can have a session with them regarding how they can keep track of their data and manage the whole project along with the research phase. So, the presentation will cover four segments in total.
a. Managing Data
b. Project Management
c. Documentation & Communication and
d. Introduction to open science.
There is often confusion regarding the usage right of the "report/research data" that are not publications but pre-project documents leading to that project. I believe they are as valuable as research data and as the year open science moves forward- this would be the perfect time to wrap up the whole thing with this area.
