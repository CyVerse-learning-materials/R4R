## Prompts

### Rose:
This is an important lesson for data science, as I have often struggled with software environments when trying to run various software, and conda is the tool I have found is best for managing dependencies.

### Bud: 
This is a reminder to make sure I have a clear conda environment for all of my scripts, rather than just throwing things together on whatever machine I am on for each program.

### Thorn: 
There wasn't a lot new for me this session. I have struggled some with PATH editing in the past and would appreciate some pointers on that, but I understand not wanting to open that can of worms in the foss session.
