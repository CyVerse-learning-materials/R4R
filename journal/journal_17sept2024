# Learner Log Entry #2 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I found the FAIR and CARE data principles really interesting. I've heard ideas from each, but never all together. I also found Caleigh's comments about how the FAIR principles are data-centric and the CARE principles are more people centric to be very interesting. 
The UA tool for DMPs seems fairly user friendly so I look forward to passing that onto my department. 
Last, I was excited to hear the brief comments about licenses. I'm looking forward to any discussion we may have about them in the Tuesday session. 

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I'm looking forward to learning more of the hand-on skills needed to utilize these tools. I think these last two weeks gave me a pretty good foundation of whereo we are situated and now I have a better understanding of how helpful basic coding is for open science!

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

On the activity for Data self-assessment, it asks 6 questions. For questions 3-6, I would love to know (at some point, not necessarily now) what the "best practices" are. As someone who is not currently conducting research, I'm interested to know what the recommendations are because it will help me better understand what tools are most helpful.

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
