## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose: 
This may seem naive to people who have been working with computers for some time, but learning the absolute basics of Command Line Interface was transformational for making working with computers less scary for me, to be quite frank. The tutorial that we walked through in the FOSS session was so easy to follow, and helped me realize that it really is just like learning another language. While I don't know a lot yet, I'm excited (and no longer as nervous) to learn more because I am confident that it is within my abilities.

### Bud: 
EnergyPlus is one of a limited number of robust building energy modeling programs that is able to produce somewhat accurate results using hourly (or smaller) timesteps. While I'm familiar with a different program, I've been interested in EnergyPlus because its Command Line Interface (CLI) and open-source nature makes it much more appealing for research. Now that I have ANY experience with CLI, I would to learn more about working directly with EnergyPlus to apply to future projects.

### Thorn:
While I use ChatGPT, I have lingering concerns about the ethics of doing so, particularly in a creative context. I would be interested in having a longer, in-person conversation to better understand how others are addressing or thinking through these concerns in their work.
