# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

We learned about the command line interface in the fourth week of FOSS. We followed a CLI example by using Linux shell and Codespaces in GitHub. We employed various commands like pwd, cd, and ls to
familiarize ourselves with the command line interface. I am also interested in using LLM chatbots to learn more about a particular topic using linked prompts.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I am looking forward to using my GitHub repository by cloning to my local machine. I will use the command line in GitBash and different commands like clone and push/pull.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

I don't know if I will use a shell script in GitHub. I use a similar script when I run in HPC or OpenSees (tcl script).

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know? 

In the last session, I learned about Imran and his current research. I got to know he is from Bangladesh, near my home country, Nepal. He changed his career from a medical doctor to a researcher in the public health domain. 
His current research is on Neurogenic disorders and the effect of climate change on them. He is looking at the data from the past 10-20 years to study the impact of climate change on the onset of neurogenic disorders.
