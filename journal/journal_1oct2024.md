## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

The highlight from the last FOSS session was learning about the Navigation commands that will help me not get lost in codespace!

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

Regarding my "Rose" point above, I'm excited to learn more about what different commands are available and how they can be best utilized. 

During the FOSS session, Jeff mentioned other "free" resources on campus that may be able to serve as alternatives to paying Microsoft for additional hours using codespace. How do those other platforms interface or compare with GitHub codespaces? Is it any different that the tutorial? 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

Beyond launching codespace from a github page, I think I'm having a challenging time conceptualizing how github and codespace relate/interact, and by extension, what products are comparable/competing products vs. what products/software/apps compliment eachother. 

I'm also a little confused on directories (and going "forward" and "backward") in codespace, but with some practice, I'm sure I'll get the hang of it. 

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
