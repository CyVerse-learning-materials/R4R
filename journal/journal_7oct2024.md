## Prompts

### Rose:
Git commands from the command line are not something I have used much, so it was good to get a lesson on the different methods for that.

### Bud: 
I have used Github before as a repository, but I rarely actually integrate it into my daily workflow. This lesson gave me some tools to make that easier in the future.

### Thorn: 
I have no major complaints about this week's session.
