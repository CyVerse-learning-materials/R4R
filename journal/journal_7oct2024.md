# Learner Log Entry #4

My current project involves running simulations and writing a lot of code. Version control could definitely come in handy here to make sure that I can keep track of all previous versions of my code. In my last project, I only uploaded the final product for resume purposes, but now that I am more familiar with GitHub, I definitely want to continually update my repo as my project progresses.
