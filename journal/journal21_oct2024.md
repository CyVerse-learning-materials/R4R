# Learner Log Entry #7

Appologies for the late entry. I was at a conference last Thursday and was slow catching up.

## Prompts

### Rose:
I don't have experience with containers, so I am really glad to get this introductory lesson on how to use them. 

### Bud: 
I want to containerize one of my research projects, just to understand the process if nothing else. I am looking forward to learning more about how to construct them next week. 

### Thorn: 
I have no major complaints this week.
