## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

The highlight from the last FOSS session was learning how accessible creating a website is. Before this session, I did not realize that you can create a a website without hiring a web designer or using a platform like Wix. 

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I'm looking forward to digging deeper into what features GitHub has. During the FOSS session, we explored new features of GitHub and along the way I realized how many different "options" there are. I'm hoping to learn more about the terminology as well so that I can gain a better understanding of what each feature does and what the implications are of selecting something (or not selecting something). As we learn more about this I'm also looking forward to being able to articulate my questions better! 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

After the last FOSS session I felt like all of my questions were addressed and I had no issues following along as we explored creating our websites. 

One barrier I think I have still is understanding the terminology of coding and using the GitHub platform, but I recongize this will lessen the more experience I get! 

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
