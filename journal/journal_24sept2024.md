# Learner Log Entry #3

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose: 
I was grateful to learn more about the purpose of a Github README in this FOSS session. My undergraduate capstone project involved publishing an online tool using Github, but I have not filled out a README file that explains what the project does and how to use it. Although the online tool is only a first iteration that requires a few updates in order to be accurate/operational, filling out the README to include this information (including what went wrong and where the project is going next) seems like really important part of good documentation. I will definitely work with my project partner to accomplish that this week!

### Bud: 
I would love to explore the possibility of creating a personal website for myself as part of my FOSS capstone project this semester. My background is in a design-based discipline (architecture), in which the typical way of communicating credibility is through a portfolio. Creating and updating a digital portfolio, however, can be a time-consuming process. It also can become complicated to share that portfolio while both limiting file size and leaving open the possibility of future updates. I think that having a personal website would be a great way to address these issues while making my portfolio more interesting/interactive. Additionally, it would allow me to highlight current science communication content and research projects alongside past design work. 

### Thorn:
My first "Deploy docs" based on the FOSS session this week failed. I do not have experience with coding, so I will need to work with others (friends, FOSS staff, the internet) in order to eventually create a website that meets my expectations.

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
