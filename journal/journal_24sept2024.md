### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

The last session was very informative. I learned many new things from the session. My particular interest is in R Quarto and GitHub website building. I want to implement the GitHub website to build my research work website.  

### Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I want to go deeper into R Quarto. I want to use R Quarto in my research to produce reproducible study and want to share it with the scientific community. 

### Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

I want to know more about R Quarto, JupyterBook, and Gitbook, which could be elaborated on.
