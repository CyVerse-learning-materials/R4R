### Rose:
I love everything open science! The highlight of the session for me was the 6 pillars of open science.



### Bud:
Open science framework.


### Thorn:
Open access mandates in the US.


### Partner discussion:
Since it was the first meeting of the semester, the partner discussion was primarily focused on getting to know other fellows better. On my desk, we talked about our research focus/interest. One overlap that I noticed is that most folks research revolved around climate change.
