### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
I really appreciated learning how to create a website. I was never aware that creating a personal website was possible using GitHub. 

### Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.
I will definitely create my own website where my bio, CV, publications and other stuff will be displayed. This tool can help me get exposed as a scientist


### Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?
Because it was my very first experience in working on the creation of a website, I struggled but Jeff was able to help at the end of the session. I will
keep working on this
