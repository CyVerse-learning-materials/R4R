### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

The reproducibility of research is fundamental to modern science. In the previous session on version control, I learned how to create and maintain consistent computing environments, which is crucial for reproducible research. 
The practical session on the GitHub reproducibility tutorial using Conda was particularly interesting, as it demonstrated how to share reproducible code with colleagues easily. 
I'm excited to implement this by sharing analysis code and ensuring that collaborators can work in the same environment, enhancing the consistency and reliability of our research outputs.

### Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I look forward to exploring version control and reproducibility tools more deeply, especially how to implement them in collaborative research projects. The session on using Conda and GitHub for reproducible code sharing sparked 
my interest in learning more about creating standardized environments across different systems. Applying these concepts to my current research will ensure that my analyses are reproducible and easier for colleagues to replicate. 
Iâ€™m excited to dive further into this area and improve how I manage and share code in my research projects.

### Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

One challenge I faced was fully understanding how to effectively manage and share the same computing environments across various systems. Although the session on version control and reproducibility was informative, I struggled with understanding how to configure Conda environments for universal compatibility across diverse platforms. 
More detailed guidance on managing environment dependencies, potential conflicts, and maintaining consistency while sharing code with colleagues using different operating systems would be beneficial.
