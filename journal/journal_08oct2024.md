# Learner Log Entry #4

### Rose:
I learned how to more effectively manage version of my code and properly document my changes, so I can revert to older versions if my code breaks. I also spent a lot of time working on my website after finding a template I really like. The template is called [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) and is designed specifically for academic websites. I also was able to link it to my personal domain by updating the DNS settings. My website domain is [csoloff.com](https://csoloff.com).

### Bud:
I have already been more deliberate with describing the changes that I push to GitHub. I also make commitments more frequently, so I can track how my code changes in more detail. I am looking forward to updating my website throughout my career and adding markdown pages where I can describe my research methods in greater detail.

### Thorn:
Working with git using the command line takes some getting used to. For now, I'll have to Google the commands to remind myself of the exact syntax.
