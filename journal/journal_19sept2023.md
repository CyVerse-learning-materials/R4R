Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

For the session on Thursday (9/14/2023) I really appreciated the overview of what open science is, and the different theories of how to think about and apply them. I was still in the midset of "open source data" era so being able to expand to a larger, more fully developed concept of open science is nice -- and I think it will enable me to understand how to apply these skills.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

I'm excited to be able to actually create a fully fledged project (capstone) because I want to be able to reproduce this format for not just my research but future research.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

Although I'm excited for the capstone, I wish there was a better descrption of what it is and what we have to do for it. i.e. deliverables, expectations, etc.

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

I need to begin getting my research ready for the overall project.
