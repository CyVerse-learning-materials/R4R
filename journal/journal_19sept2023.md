Following the Rose/Bud/Thorn model:

### **Rose:**
The introduction of open science principles has profoundly shaped my perception of the comprehensive accessibility of academic scientific endeavors. While I previously recognized the significance of open access software and the imperative nature of open data, my recent immersion in the entire open science framework has enlightened me on the potential for its seamless integration into my research pursuits. My evolving comprehension of open methodologies and open access publications has fueled my aspiration to incorporate these principles in the trajectory of my future research endeavors.

### **Bud:**
Comprehending Open Science is akin to aligning with a particular intellectual paradigm. Its underlying objective is to actively participate in a movement that regards science as an open and accessible platform, one that thrives through cumulative contributions. As an early-stage academic, I am keenly aware of the transformative potential of integrating these principles into my research methodologies and shaping my publication perspective. Specifically, I foresee a conscious practice of prioritizing publications based on their accessibility as an integral component of my research process.

### **Thorn:**
The concept of open peer review presents a nuanced duality that merits careful consideration. The intrinsic value of research exclusivity is a compelling aspect worth preserving. However, the proposition of making research openly accessible during the preprint stage necessitates a cautious approach and a more thoughtful examination.
Moreover, the laudable notion of universal research usability must be balanced against the potential erosion of intellectual ownership and originality. It is imperative to explore alternative solutions to mitigate the risk of intellectual ideas and work losing their essence. The unsettling prospect of an employer possibly compensating a researcher solely for labor, without acknowledging their intellectual contributions, underscores the need for a distinct resolution.

### **Additional thought:**
I could not save the edited file from my machine. Navigating through files needs some more context from my side.
