Rose: I enjoyed learnign how to work with containers. 
This would be really useful to spread my code and collaborate. 

Bud: I tried to use someone else's container and failed horribly. 
Now that I gained more technical experience with containers it would be nice to go back and try to run the container again

Thorn: I'm curious about the developer process. 
That is, if I use someone's else container but then I want to add new code to its work, can I easily merge my new dependencies into their container or do I have to create a fully new container.
Moover, can containers and environments be mixed?
