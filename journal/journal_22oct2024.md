# Learner Log Entry #6

### Rose:
I found it helpful that you can just preload a package with all the dependencies and share it with your code. I think this would be helpful if I am trying to share my code within my group quickly and not have to worry about making sure they install the python environment and packages correctly.

### Bud:
I would like to try and apply this to my scripts and integrate it into a GitHub repository. It would be interesting to see if I can run my code on a new machine without the headache of install the correct environment and dependencies.

### Thorn:
Installing docker and running it correctly from command line does require a lot of steps. Perhaps there are cases where just presenting the user with a requirements.txt file may be a quicker way to run new code. But in there are cases where containers are better, like to avoid interference with other pieces of software or operating systems.
