# Learner Log Entry #7

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I thought it was cool to see how containers can eliminate the multiple steps of "tracking down" all the necessary elements that the original researcher used. More specifically, I liked that (if I'm understanding their use correctly) they also make reproducing someone's research more efficient. Personally, I think the more efficient we make reproducing our results, the more likely it is that people will engage with our projects! 

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I'm looking forward to learning how to create containers because they seem to be a very useful tool, especially if your research has a broad audience.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

Does using containers mitigate the potential issue of having a software version mis-match (we discussed this issue last week related to Cassidy's question). If so, is it accurate to say that using containers increases reproducibility? If so, are there any circumstances under which using a container would _not_ be advisable? 

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
