### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
The world of computational reproducibility is completely new to me. I appreciated the tutorial on this topic area and am interested in doing more tutorials that could be related to the field of health sciences. 

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.
I am looking forward to learning how I can apply these concepts to qualitative, mixed methods, or community-based participatory research. At this point, I am having difficulty applying computational reproducibility to my research specifically. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?
I want to do more tutorials to become comfortable with codespaces and the Github platform overall but I am not sure where to find tutorials that I am interested in. How was the reproducibility tutorial using Conda found? Or was it something that you created for FOSS?
## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
