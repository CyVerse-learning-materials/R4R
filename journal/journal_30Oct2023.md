# Learner Log Entry #3 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I'm excited to have learned about containers, and to have the resource to dive in and use thme. Some of my friends who have graduated and gotten jobs in industry say they use docker and containers every day. I'm also exited to use this becuase I've lost a lot of scripts and data in the past and this can be another way to save my work.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

I'm interested in using containers to work both on my dissertation and to implement in personal projects. I'm also interested in seeing how they are actually implemented in the workspace.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

I think I would have liked a more tutorial type of introduction to learning containers. For example, a goal or outcome in mind and the steps it takes to get to that goal.

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
