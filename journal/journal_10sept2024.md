# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

### I had the opportunity to hear about Alyssa Fink's research, a first-year master's student in Architecture & the Institute for Energy Solutions.

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

### We had the opportunity to learn about each other's research and explore how Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) can benefit our individual projects.

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know? 

### Rose:
### I had a fascinating discussion with Alyssa, who is focused on remodeling existing buildings to reduce energy consumption and lower CO2 emissions. It was insightful to learn how her research combines architecture with sustainable energy solutions, which can have a significant impact on reducing the carbon footprint of older structures.

### Bud:
### I'm excited to see how Alyssa plans to incorporate Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) into her research, particularly in how she might use open data or collaboration tools to enhance her project. We also discussed potential ways to integrate new technologies and materials to further reduce energy usage, which is something I’d like to explore in my own work as well. My work is focused on reserching substitute materials utilized in processes, systems, and product designs in order to reduce the global warming potential.

### Thorn:
### One challenge we encountered during our conversation was the complexity of balancing sustainability goals with the constraints of existing building structures. It wasn’t entirely clear how certain tools within FOSS could directly address these architectural limitations, so further discussion or research may be needed to explore solutions.
