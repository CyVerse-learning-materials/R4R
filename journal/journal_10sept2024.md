# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose 1:
One highlight of the first FOSS session for me was learning about the Author's Accepted Manuscript (AAM) as a path to Open Access that both includes peer review and meets upcoming Nelson Memo requirements. Previous conversations that I have had about open access have focused on pre-prints, but I have been concerned about the quality of these documents, especially considering the number of errors that I have found in published work. 

### Rose 2: 
I greatly enjoyed learning about data management plans as a part of this FOSS session. I have experienced how easy it is to let reference organization alone get out of hand. As I will be dealing with large amounts of data for the first time starting this semester, I would love to use this opportunity to create and share a data management plan on a platform like DMPTool. Since the FOSS (and R4R) communities provide such a wealth of experience in data management, this will better enable me to ask for feedback from outside of my research group.

### Bud 1&2: 
I'm looking forward to digging deeper into best practices for open data as a part of my data management plan. This includes how to organize/label things now for my own benefit and for future access, and also to learning exactly how I can make data available once my work is complete.

### Thorn 1: 
I'm somewhat unclear on what constitutes an open methodology. There is, of course, some research I have seen that clearly does not meet this criteria, either through vague descriptions of methodology or obvious errors (formulas that don't add up, etc.). But in general, WHO should open methodologies be open to? Should the be designed to be accessible for a young researcher like myself, who may need much more "spelled out" that many more experienced researchers take for granted? Should they be "open" to the peers of each researcher?

### Thorn 2
I really would like to learn more about CARE principles. While they sound wonderful in theory, they seem to require that all group(s) of people who are participating in research have ongoing authority. When group(s) of people who participate are cohesive, and perhaps have a few representatives who have the authority to speak on behalf of the entire group, it would certainly be easier to have ongoing conversations than with group(s) of people who are not cohesively organized. How could/should the CARE principles be involved in the latter case?

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
