### Rose:
I enjoyed discussing open science and the positive impact that it can bring, particularly for people who less access to data science resources.

### Bud: 
I am excited to learn about GitHub more and how to organize my code, so it can be shared effectively while collaborating with others.

### Thorn: 
I think it will take some time to grasp all the terminology and acronyms to describe data science methodology.

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
