# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I enjoyed the discussion of open science skills. In particular, I enjoyed learning exactly what "open source software" is. I've used plenty of open source softwares such as Python, R, C++, Julia, etc., but have never been explicitly aware of what it means for a software to be open source besides the fact it is free to use. 

### Bud: 
One thing I am looking into digging more into is GitHub. I've used GitHub several times in the past, but I'm yet to really gain a good understanding of what I'm doing and the terminology. For instance, I've cloned repositories and committed results, but I still don't really understand what a "committ", "branch", "fork', etc. is. Also, I'd like to know if using GitHub desktop is just as good as using the terminal for updated github repositories. These are all things that I've wondered about in the past, but never rarely investigated myself. 

### Thorn: 
Harping back on my bud, a lot of the GitHub terminology is confusing and unclear. I'm sure I will get more familiar with it as the FOSS sessions unfold. 

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
