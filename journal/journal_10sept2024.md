### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I appreciated the discussions of how open science interacts with the publishing and peer review systems.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I am looking forward to learning more about open science methodology so that I can improve the quality and accessibility of my work.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

The first session was mostly a lot of introductory material and didn't include a lot of concrete tools yet. 

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
