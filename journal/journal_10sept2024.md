# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose 1:
One highlight of the first FOSS session for me was learning about the Author's Accepted Manuscript (AAM) as a path to Open Access that both includes peer review and meets upcoming Nelson Memo requirements. Previous conversations that I have had about open access have focused on pre-prints, but I have been concerned about the quality of these documents, especially considering the number of errors that I have found in published work. 

### Bud 1: 
I'm looking forward to digging deeper into best practices for open data. This includes how to organize/label things now for my own benefit and for future access, and also to learning exactly how I can make data available once my work is complete.

### Thorn 1: 
I'm somewhat unclear on what constitutes an open methodology. There is, of course, some research I have seen that clearly does not meet this criteria, either through vague descriptions of methodology or obvious errors (formulas that don't add up, etc.). But in general, WHO should open methodologies be open to? Should the be designed to be accessible for a young researcher like myself, who may need much more "spelled out" that many more experienced researchers take for granted? Should they be "open" to the peers of each researcher?

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
