### Rose:
I enjoyed discussing open science and the positive impact that it can bring, particularly for people who less access to data science resources.

### Bud: 
I am excited to learn about GitHub more and how to organize my code, so it can be shared effectively while collaborating with others.

### Thorn: 
I think it will take some time to grasp all the terminology and acronyms to describe data science methodology.

## Partner Discussions

Joy is in the epidemiology department. He works with 3 datasets from the College of Public health. The datasets are from an App which was run from 2017-2019 along the U.S.-Mexico boarder on the U.S. side. He focuses in identifying features which make it more likely for someone to use the App.

It was interesting exchanging research topics and I think we both learned a lot about each other's respective fields.
