The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you were probably paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know? Is this a possibility of future collaboration between you and your partner(s)?
