# Learner Log Entry #5

### Rose:
I was particularly interested in implementing version control to more effectively work on my personal website. I have been working solely on the main branch, but I know that that poses a risk - if I mess something up while I'm working on it, the website could go down. Going forward, I definately intend to work on a separate branch, then merge my changes once I have made several and am fairly confident that they will be functional.

### Bud: 
I would like to dig deeper into Git Large File Storage. In the architectural field, many file formats (like Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator, etc.) are difficult to collaborate on. Collaboration typically entails passing very large files back and forth, and hoping that your changes are not lost. If Git Large File Storage can make it easier to track changes and avoid passing large files around, that would be great.

### Thorn: 
I need to spend more time studying some essential terms for version control, like the difference between pull, push, merge, etc. They make sense in theory, and when they are explained to me, I simply need to practice using them myself!

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
