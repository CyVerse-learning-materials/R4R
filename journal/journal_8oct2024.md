## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:

My rose from this week's FOSS session was learning about the different version control tools. I think this will be specifically helpful to people (likely in the legal field) who are conducting research over the course of multiple years and using aggregate data to draw their conclusions. Because research like this will likely span more than three years, the law students assisting the professors will "turn over" as they graduate and making sure that they incorporate best practices with using version control it might mitigate the barrier of new students lacking experience/knowledge.

The second part of my rose from this week is learning how to _undo_ new actions in github. So far, I've felt like once I do something in a folder or branch, especially if I commit the change, that it is rather permanent. It feels encouraging to know that there is a bit of leeway. 

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I'm excited to spend more time learning about markdown and the "cheat sheet" that Michele mentioned. I think that becoming more familiar with this language (if that is the right word) will help me more efficiently naviagate GitHub. Pending feedback from the R4R/FOSS team, I'm interested/considering including an intro to some of the "most helpful" features of markdown as it pertains to website building. I know this is from weeks ago now, but it was cool to see those websites quickly today :) 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

I'm a little bit confused about how to download my repo, make changes, and then re-upload/reconcile the changes I made locally with the live repository online. My confusion is likely because this feels counter-intuitive, but as I reflect on what about what is still a bit cloudy to me, this takes the cake!

I'd also like to learn more about the platforms that we've touched on for large data storage. It is my general understanding currently that paying for storage through github/microsoft is not advisable, but I'd like to know more about what is recommended and how it interfaces with github locally and online. 

## Partner Discussions

During the in-person Tuesday session, you will be paired with another fellow to get to know them and also discuss a FOSS topic. Please introduce yourself to your partner and briefly talk about your field of study and projects. 

For our first session, please discuss with your partner your thoughts on FOSS Intro to Open Science. Please use the Rose, Bud, Thorn prompts to spark discussion. 

Please give a brief summary of what you talked about. Did you learn anything from your partner regarding their research or a FOSS topic? Did you help your partner learn something they did not know?
