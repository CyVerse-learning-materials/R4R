## Rose:
It is very interesting to learn about FAIR principles, which are a way to achieve the goal of openscience, sharing data and knowledge with each other.
Also, learning about organizing and storing data in storage is very useful to better manage and store data.

## Bud:
To make my research data reuseable and share it in a more useful way, it is beneficial to learn the FAIR framework.

## Thorn:
The most challenging part is convincing my research group to implement the FAIR principles, considering the time and effort it would take to prepare reuseable data. 
Also, some members of our research group do have unorganized manner to manage the data on our shared storage, so making them learn how to manage the storage would be challenging
