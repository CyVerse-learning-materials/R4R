#  **Learner Log Entry #3**

Prompts
Following the Rose/Bud/Thorn model:

### **Rose:**
As a new researcher, data management methods-in general is something I feel I have a lot to learn about. In the field of architecture, managing data is often not complemented by an organized process. In the profession, seperate professional bodies like firms, permit authorities or cities have their own way of storing data. Sometimes, they are even manual and not interchangable. Working with that kind of data often can be subjected to a long sorting process. The knowledge about data managment in general therefore is something I can incorporate not only in my current research, but also in the profession for unlocking potential of data exchange.

### **Bud:**
Liscensing is often seen as a troublesome extra work in any design related industry. Its easy to get your creative works copied and having clear knowledge about liscensing makes the work equitable to creators of every level. This is something I would explore more about and would be interested to know in details.

### **Thorn:**
We have discussed in the session that there can be multiple types of research data. Sometimes, even if someone collects certain data from a source, the research adds layers to that data. I feel in these cases liscensing and management (probably version control too) would be a crucial part going forward. This specific session did not touch that part. However, I see version control existing in the upcoming points of the curriculum. I would be able to grasp the whole concept once that is touched in detail. Right now, I feel my knowledge remains segmented about that part.

### **Additional thought:**
We could look at couple of examples of liscensing in detail to understand their differences. I feel that is essential to have a good understanding about that.
