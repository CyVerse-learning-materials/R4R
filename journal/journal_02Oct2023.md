## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I am now seriously considering getting a PMP certificate (not anytime soon) becaues I always feel like i'm in the dark when it comes to organizing my projects. With this being said, I'm also exited to look into using agile managment for my research, particularly to help a team that has a lot of turn-over due to the nature of its set-up. Because the data is somewhat dynamic I think that having iterations of structuring is a good idea to help organize things. I'm also excited to try to implement this into my graduate assistanship because part of my job there is to keep my work (and the data) sustainable, i.e. well documented for those who come after me.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

To continue from above, I'm excited to learn more about the agile method by trying to implement it and see if it will  work for my own research as well as for my GRA-ship.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

I wasn't sure how focusing on how bad project management examples helped, but I think it did work to state the obvious, which might not be obvious since we were all stating similar things. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

On a personal note, I feel like all PIs, or those working with students (in academia) should take some type of project management training.
