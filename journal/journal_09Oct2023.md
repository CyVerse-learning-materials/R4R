## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I'm excited to build a website for my dissertation because I've had this idea in mind for a while. I already have a website for my CV and data science projects, but I feel like it's very unorganized. Essentially I thought I'd create a shiny app/website that housed my work and made the visualizations (somewhat) interactive. Thursday helped provide me with options other than shiny.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

I'm looking forward to understanding how to organize github.io pages so that I can apply that to my current webiste and have a better online presence. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

Althought it was due to technical difficulties, showing us the correct end product after creating a website woul have been helpful. I've been trying to work on mine but after copying and pasting things I seem to have lost the website url. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

Maybe there can be a follow-up on creating the webiste?
