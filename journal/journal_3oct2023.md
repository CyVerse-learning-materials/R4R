In this session, I learned about the workings of project management and how beneficial it can be for enhancing collaboration within a team. Additionally, I realized that a lack of project management could result in a disorganized workflow where team members may not clearly understand their primary tasks. This could further lead to poor communication and, overall, hinder the successful completion of the project.  

### Bud: 
Learning about project management has led me to realize that it's not merely a practice to be implemented through projects; it could also represent a manner of thinking, a way of living. I began to envision applying project management principles to every task I undertake in my life. This approach would aid in completing tasks in an organized manner, providing insight into forthcoming steps, and preparing adequately for them.

### Thorn: 
The challenging aspect for me is understanding how to implement project management in both my personal life and work-related projects. Additionally, sometimes the simplicity of the workflow misleads me into thinking that there is no need for such practices. Moreover, I am contemplating treating each day as a project to complete, allowing me to practice implementing project management techniques.
