I use version control in my everyday research so, I was already familiar with the concept before the class. I liked the "FINAL".doc cartoon though and the way the instructor simplified the concept and process of version control.

### Partner discussions:
I found last week's class discussion to be quite informative. I have never really paused to reflect on the ethics aspect of all things associated with LLM models such as chatGPT etc. Having such a diverse class helped bring various perspectives to the discussion and I really enjoyed that. I feel everyone who uses LLM should have knowledge of the things we discussed in class. Maybe as a class we can come up with a cheatsheet on the ethics and legal know of LLM that we can share with the university community.
