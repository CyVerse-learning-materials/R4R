Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
It was interesting to learn that you could track history of changes you made in Github. 
Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.
This lesson could help in developing my website. As a beginner, it's important that I should be able to track the changes of my work as I progress
Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?
I just realize that developing those requires a lot of practice. Particularly for me, I need more practice and it's fine that videos of the lessons are posted on YouTube so that I can watch them afterwards
