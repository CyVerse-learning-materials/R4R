Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
Last session we learned how to talk to computers. It was in interesting session for me as that was my first experience with command line language. I need to practice a lot of it
Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.
I was left behind during the lesson and did not catch up. So it might be hard for me to say what I look forward to digging into deeper. I need more practice
Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?
The lesson seemed to go at a fast pace for me as a new learned of the lesson
