Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
The lesson was similar to the one from the preceding week, meaning that we learned about reproducing someone else's work. The difference was that time time we learned how you can package up the code and all of the software and send it to your colleague as a Container
Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.
I am still interested in how I can now be able to share my code to allow other people to reproduce my results
Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?
The challenge was that Michele's code did not work for several times, which made me struggle while He was trying to solve the issue
